### Seasonality in Orders

To understand seasonal purchasing patterns, we analyze product purchase variation with:
- **Hour of the day**
- **Day of the week**
- **Week of the year:** not directly available in this dataset. However, a proxy can be inferred from the `days since prior order` column to approximate yearly buying trends.


#### Number of Orders by Day of the Week and Hour of the Day

```python
# Query: total orders per day of week & hour of day
query ="""
SELECT order_dow AS day_of_the_week, 
       order_hour_of_day, 
       COUNT(order_id) AS number_of_orders_placed 
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_dow, order_hour_of_day
"""
df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)

# Map numeric days to day names
day_of_week_dict={0: 'Sun', 1: 'Mon', 2: 'Tue', 3: 'Wed', 4: 'Thu', 5: 'Fri', 6: 'Sat'}
df['day_of_the_week']=df['day_of_the_week'].map(day_of_week_dict)

# Visualization 1. Orders across hours, split by weekday
grouped_data_dow=df.groupby('day_of_the_week')['number_of_orders_placed'].sum().reset_index()
sns.barplot(data=grouped_data_dow , x='day_of_the_week', y='number_of_orders_placed', 
            hue='day_of_the_week', palette='viridis', ax=axes[0])

# Visualization 2. Orders by weekday
fig, axes = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(14, 6)) 
sns.lineplot(data=df, x="order_hour_of_day", y="number_of_orders_placed", 
             hue="day_of_the_week", palette='viridis', linewidth=3,  ax=axes[1])
```

> [!tip] Insight
> Number of orders peak on **Sundays and Mondays**, especially **Sunday evenings** and **Monday mornings**.  Across all days, most purchases occur between **9 AM â€“ 4 PM**.

#### avg number of distinct products in an order depending on day of week and hour of day

```

insight: number of products per order on average hovers around 9-11. it is typically high in Fri-mon, sunday being the highest. On all days higher product containing orders happen between 10 pm and 1 am. in fri to mon however another peak emerges around 9 am where people place orders with more products in it.
